        Squeakr is a k-mer-counting and multiset-representation system using the recently-introduced
        counting quotient filter (CQF) Pandey et al. (2017), a feature-rich approximate membership
        query (AMQ) data structure.

        Squeakr is memory-efficient, consuming 1.5Xâ€“4.3X less memory than the state-of-the-art. It
        offers competitive counting performance, in fact, it is faster for larger k-mers, and
        answers queries about a particular k-mer over an order-of- magnitude faster than other
        systems. The Squeakr representation of the k-mer multiset turns out to be immediately
        useful for downstream processing (e.g., De Bruijn graph traversal) because it supports fast
        queries and dynamic k-mer insertion, deletion, and modification.
